 # General Guidelines for Code Review

✨ How to do amazing code reviews ✨
- Some personal gleanings from yet another insightful session by Tech Career Growth Community 🌱 -

- Code reviews are in fact an integral part of building the engineering culture in your team. Therefore it should be a priority.
- The goal in code reviews isn't necessarily to be right.
- Most people don't like doing code reviews (would rather work on their own stuff - understandable)
- So be thankful when someone takes the time to review your code because that means they took time out of their day to read/test/leave feedback (which you can then use to learn and get better!)
- Use tentative language, even if you're more senior.

Bottom line, doing code reviews can be a hurdle for some to prioritize doing regularly. Some tips to lower that barrier:

🏞 Provide context in pull requests
- What problem does this code solve? Paint the background story for the reader.
- It takes a few more minutes on your end, but it's like a "tax" that everyone pays for the greater good/health of the team.

💯 Include quality tester guidance
- If it's UI-related, include screenshots. Sometimes a video might be helpful
- A well-thought-out guide also gives other reviewers assurance that this code works

📝 One diff, one thesis
- As much as you can help it, keep the code in your pull requests focused on one thesis. It's easier to review smaller snippets of code rather than 5000 lines.
